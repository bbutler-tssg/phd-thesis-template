\newglossaryentry{self-similarity}{
  name=self-similarity
 ,description={A self-similar object is exactly or approximately similar to a part of itself. Within the domain of traffic rate variation, it relates to similar rate throughput at different time scales (seconds, hours, days).}

  name={Hurst parameter}
 ,description={is the index of dispendence, and is the relative tendency of a time series to either strongly regress to the mean or cluster in a direction}
}
\newglossaryentry{Packet trace}{
  name={Packet trace}
 ,description={is a time series of packet sizes, consisting of packet time inter arrival time in seconds and packet size in bits.}

  name={Weighted Fair Queueing}
 ,description={is a packet scheduling technique that uses a weighted algorithm to de-queue packets from multiple queues fairly.}
}
\newglossaryentry{Priority Queueing}{
  name={Priority Queueing}
 ,description={Within a multiple queue system, packets arriving at a priority queue will be de-queued first, thus ensuring traffic has the least likelihood of being rejected during times of high network load}

\newglossaryentry{ATM_gloss}{
  name=ATM
 ,description={Asynchronous Transfer Mode is a cell relay, packet switching network and data link layer protocol which encodes data traffic in small (53 byte; 48 byte of data and 5 bytes of header information) fixed sized cells.}

\newglossaryentry{Frame Relay}{
  name={Frame Relay}
 ,description={Frame relay consists of an efficient data transmission technique used to send digital information quickly and cheaply in a relay of frames to one or many destinations from one or many end-points.}
}
\newglossaryentry{Forwarding Equivalence Class}{
  name={Forwarding Equivalence Class}
 ,description={Each router in a connectionless network makes an independent forwarding decision for a packet's next hop destination based on analysis of the packets header and some routing logic. Packets which result in the same forwarding decision are considered equivalent and are partitioned into a Forward Equivalence Class.}
